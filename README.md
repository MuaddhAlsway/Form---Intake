# 📘 Project Deep Dive in C:
## [📝 Form — Intake System in C] 

- This repository contains multiple C programs that simulate hospital intake forms, user interactions, and different logic structures in C. It's designed as a hands-on learning project for building terminal applications using pure C code.

## [🏥 Hospital Intake Form – C Language Terminal App]  

- Welcome to a simple yet powerful **hospital intake system** built entirely in C!  
This command-line application simulates a real-world patient intake experience — from entering personal information to choosing your medical condition and preferred doctor.

--- 
## 📌 Features - Form Intake System ...
- 🧾 Input patient name, age, and health condition
- 🔁 Validate inputs and use conditional logic
- 📋 Menu selection using `scanf` and `switch-case`
- 🩺 Doctor assignment based on condition and preference
- 🧠 Learning through multiple C implementations
  
## 💡 Features - Hospital Intake Form 
- 🧑‍⚕️ Accepts and validates patient name and age.
- ❓ Asks about the patient’s condition (Sick, Tired, Emergency).
- ⏱️ Captures how long the condition has lasted (Week, Month, Year).
- 🩺 Allows doctor selection based on condition type.
- 📄 Outputs a detailed, structured intake report for hospital use.

  

---

## 📌 Notice

  - 🔢 There are multiple .c files with different C logic used for experimentation, testing, and learning.

  - 📂 All executables are placed in the /bin folder for separation.

  - 🧪 tempCodeRunnerFile.c is for quick tests and should not be considered part of the final system.

## 💻 How to Run

### 1️⃣ Compile the Code

Use GCC (or any C compiler):

```bash
gcc UpgradeConditionHospital.c -o hospital_for
```
## ▶️ Run the program:
```
 ./hospital_form
```

## 🎯 Sample Output
```
Enter your name: John Doe
Enter your age: 45
What is your condition? (A - Sick, B - Tired, C - Emergency): A

Welcome to a Hospital Form
Name: John Doe
